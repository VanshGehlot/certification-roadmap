# Free Certificates & Learning Tracks for Students & Professionals 🚀  

### Learn → Build → Show Proof → Repeat


If this repo helps you learn (or helps your team), please **star** it — it helps us keep improving and adding more high-quality resources ⭐

---

## Why this repo works
- **Curated, not cluttered:** practical learning tracks and reputable providers.
- **Proof-first approach:** every section pushes you toward something you can show (certificate, badge, portfolio output).
- **Designed for momentum:** “Fast Wins” + guided stacks so you don’t get stuck deciding.
- **Built for students and leaders:** students get a clear path; leaders get measurable proof and consistency.

---

## Quick Start (60 seconds)
1) Pick ONE: **[Fast Wins](#fast-wins)** • **[Job-ready Stacks](#job-ready-stacks)** • **[Browse by Category](#browse-by-category)**
2) Finish **1 credential this week**
3) Ship **1 small output** (notes, screenshots, mini project, public link)
4) Come back and stack the next one

> Rule: Don’t collect links. Collect proof.
